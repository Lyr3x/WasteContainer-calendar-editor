# WasteContainer-calendar-editor
This tool updates the .ics file provided by BonnOrange to create a new .ics for the next day.
As a result there are two .ics files. One for the exhibition dates and one for the dates to put the container back in.

I also enabled the todoist integration to google calendar, where i imported both .ics files. 
That way i get the approriate todos in todoist whenever i need to interact with a waste container.
